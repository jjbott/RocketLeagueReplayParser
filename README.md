# Rocket League Replay Parser
Parses replay files generated by the game Rocket League. Parses to C# objects, which can be serialized to JSON.

Supports all replay files created by Rocket League version 2.56 (released 2025-09-16) and earlier. Newer versions may work as well - updates don't always change the replay format. Changes to the replay format are usually supported within a few days. Please create an issue for any replays that fail to parse, or for replays that parse incorrectly.

Includes a library that can be used in your project (```Install-Package RocketLeagueReplayParser```) as well as a basic console based front end that can be used to convert a replay file to JSON. 

#### Example usage:

* Convert a single replay file to JSON, outputting the result to stdout

```RocketLeagueReplayParser.exe example.replay```

* Convert a single replay file to JSON, outputting the result to a file (named <file>.json)

```RocketLeagueReplayParser.exe example.replay --fileoutput```

* Convert all replay files in a directory to JSON, outputting the result to files

```RocketLeagueReplayParser.exe "\\path\to\replay\files" --fileoutput --d```

Further instructions can be found by running ```RocketLeagueReplayParser.exe --help```

### History

This was the first project that could parse replays all the way! For a good while it was the reference implentation for all others. Thankfully others have taken that on in the years since.
